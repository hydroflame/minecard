Equi
====
Equi is a deck building incremental about balancing an ecosystem.

The game has 2 main meters: fauna and flora.
Your basic deck has 1/2 basic fauna card and half basic flora card.
Those card increase their respective meters by some small amount,
while reducing the other meter by an even smaller amount.
Each meter has a range in the middle considered optimal.
(Eg from 40% to 60%) Additionally. Gaining either of these
resources above half of the total meter reduces its gains and
gaining that resource when under 50 percent gives it a boost.
With these rules in place and proper formulas the badic deck
should, more often than not, stabilise around the equilibrium
zone. All decks have 20 cards. The starting deck has the following
cards: 9 fauna, 9 flora, 2 vitality.

Gaining vitality  (by playing vitality cards)
is vital to progress. Firstly. A lot of cards
scale with vitality. For instance basic fauna
and basic flora give more fauna/flora respectively.
That will cause an imbalance in the ecosystem.

The second way to use vitality is to spend it
in order to improve your ecosystem.
Some example of upgrades:
- Make the size of the equilibrium range larger
- Improve the nerf above half and boost below
  half of the meters (makes it easier to maintain
  equilibrium), but reduces the range of equilibrium.
- purchase nature cards (basic type of cards)
- purchase environment cards. (see below)
- upgrade environment cards.

Doom counter: every 50 turns a doom card is played
from the doom deck. These are a variety of bad
events that disturb your ecosystem. E.g. a heat wave
could kill all your fauna. 

There is 1 special doom card that has a high likelyhood
of appearing when the ecosystem is dead. Called
"Spark of life". This card immediately brings your
ecosystem into perfect balance but gives a debuff
where no vitality can be gained for 50 turns. This special
event is only there to prevent deadlocks.


Environment cards

environments cards are a special kind of card that
do not go in the play deck. They are instead placed
on a N by M grid of empty spaces. Placing those cards
give bonus (like faster card flip rate, larger
equilibrium range, vitality multiplier). Certain
combinations give larger bonus. These card can be
upgraded for larger individual bonuses.

Example of cards:
(Nature)
- fauna: increases fauna at the cost of a little flora.
- flora: increases flora at the cost of a little fauna.
- vitality: gain vitality based on equilibrium.
- algea: increases flora. ignores nerf.
- wind: converts fauna to flora or vice versa. Based on which is higher.
- fertilizer: boosts flora gain for 5 turns.
(Environment)
hourglass: Increases card flip rate by 5%
land: Increases equilibrium range by 5%
vitality boost: Increases vitality gain by 5%
Rocky coast: reduces the bad effects of doom cards by 5%.
