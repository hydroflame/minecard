Equi
====
Equi is a deck building incremental about balancing an ecosystem.

The core concept of the game is called equilibrium. The game has 2 variable meters called fauna and flora. To achieve equilibrium both of those meters need to be within equilibrium range. Typically if the meter is between 40% and 60% full that meter is in equilibrium and if both fauna and flora are in the target range than the ecosystem is in equilibrium. The range in which a meter is considered balanced is called the goldilock zone and it can change in size.

Each second a card is played at random from the players main deck (called the nature deck). These card go back straight in the nature deck again. Those card can have various effect. From affecting the flora and fauna meters to giving buffs or acquiring resources.

The 2 most important cards are the "Fauna" and "Flora" card.

The "Flora" card increases the flora meter by some amount while reducing the fauna meter. The "Fauna" card does the opposite. Each of these card scale with resources.

These card will get more powerful with time. To counter the ever increasing power of the cards the meters gains are nerfed. For example gaining 10 flora from 50% will result in a meter at 60%. But gaining another 10 flora will only result in a meter at 65%. This will make it very difficult to reach a full meter and eventually the gains from a card will cancel the loss to the opposite meter. Maintaining equilibrium. This mechanic is called overpopulation and it can vary in power.

All decks have exactly 20 cards and cannot be played without exactly 20. The starting deck has the following
cards: 9 "Fauna", 9 "Flora", 2 "Vitality"

The "Vitality" card gives the player an amount of vitality based on how well the ecosystem is in equilibrium. Vitality is a very important resource in the game. Its primary purpose is to make the players card stronger. For example both the "Fauna" and "Flora" card fill their meter more with more vitality (note that "Flora" benefits more from vitality than "Fauna"). Vitality has another purpose.

The second way to use vitality is to spend it
in order to improve your ecosystem.
Some example of upgrades:
- Make the size of the goldilock zone (and vitality gains)
- Improve the strength of overpopulation (reduce the size of the goldilock zone)
- purchase nature cards (basic type of cards)
- purchase environment cards. (see below)
- upgrade environment cards.

Entropy counter: every 50 turns a entropy card is played
from the entropy deck. These are a variety of bad
events that disturb your ecosystem. E.g. a heat wave
could kill all your fauna, a drought could reduce flora gains for 10 turns, a abundance of oxygen could boost fauna gain to unmaintainable levels.

There is 1 special entropy card that has a high likelyhood
of appearing only when the ecosystem is dead. Called
"Spark of life". This card immediately brings your
ecosystem into perfect balance but gives a debuff
where no resources can be gained for 50 turns. This special
event is only there to prevent deadlocks.

The players can stop the game at any time to swap any cards they acquired in their nature deck.


Environment cards

environments cards are a special kind of card that
do not go in the nature deck. They are instead placed
on a N by M grid of empty spaces. Placing those cards
give bonus (like faster nature card play rate, larger goldilock zone, vitality multiplier). Certain
combinations give larger bonus. These card can be
upgraded for larger individual bonuses.

Example of cards:
(Nature)
- Fauna: increases fauna at the cost of a little flora.
- Flora: increases flora at the cost of a little fauna.
- Vitality: gain vitality based on equilibrium.
- Algea: increases flora. ignores overpopulation.
- Wind: converts fauna to flora or vice versa. Based on which is higher.
- Fertilizer: boosts flora gain for 5 turns.

(Environment)
Hourglass: Increases card flip rate by 5%
Land: Increases equilibrium range by 5%
Vitality boost: Increases vitality gain by 5%
Rocky coast: reduces the bad effects of entropy cards by 5%.

Prestiging: After acquiring enough resources players can prestige to convert all their vitality in  life. The next tier resource. Card power add lofe and vitality together to calculate their power.
Life can also be spent on powerful upgrades or cards.

After gaining enough life the player automatically completes the "spring challenge". This is the basic challenge that everyone starts in without being aware. By completing a challenge players are awarded a universe card. These cards are never reset but only 3 of them can be active at any given time. Each challenges can be completed multiple times. Getting harder each time. To power up the associated universe card. Other challenges give different universe card.
